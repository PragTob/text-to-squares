# How to fork and clone a repository

1. Go to GitHub and find the repository to clone.
   We use https://github.com/svenfuchs/text-to-squares
   for this project group.

2. Click the "Fork" button on the top right. (If you
   have a window listing accounts then select your personal
   account.) GitHub should fork the repository to your
   account and redirect to it. I.e. you should be on
   https://github.com/[your-name]/text-to-squares now.

3. Copy the "Read+Write access" url, e.g.
   git@github.com:svenfuchs/text-to-squares.git

4. Open the terminal and go to your projects directory
   by doing

   $ cd path/to/my/projects

   (use whatever path your projects directory is at)

5. Now clone your repository fork to your local computer
   by doing:

   $ git@github.com:[your-name]/text-to-squares.git

   and change into the new directory:

   $ cd text-to-squares

# How to add a new file to your git repository, commit and push it

1. Go to your repository on your local computer:

   $ cd path/to/my/projects/text-to-squares

2. Review the status of your repository:

   $ git status

3. Add all files to the so called "staging area" in git
   (i.e. tell git to add the file to the list of files
   that will be committed)

   $ git add .

4. Actually do the commit

   $ git commit -m 'wohooo, a new commit'

   if you want us to review your commit, then you can
   include our GitHub handles to the commit message
   like so: @rkh @lucaspinto @svenfuchs

5. Review the commits you have

   $ git log

   (you might have to hit "q" in order to get out of the
   log view)

6. Push the new commit to GitHub

   $ git push

Congratulations, you have shared your work on GitHub!

# How to add a git remote

1. Think of a name. Any name. Let's call it svenfuchs. Nice.

2. You need associate name with the Git repo's URL

    $ git remote add svenfuchs git://github.com/svenfuchs/text-to-squares

# How to pull changes from your repository

1. Use `git pull`

    $ git pull

# Pulling from someone else's repo

1. Say whom and from what branch you want to pull from

    $ git pull svenfuchs master

:)
